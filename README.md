# Tactical Mapping App
### _Keep track of your battle buddies_

_Tactical Mapping_ is an app and associated hardware for keeping track of your battle buddies when out in the field. It uses LoRa radios, Bluetooth, and Android phones to give each user the exact location of all your buddies on an offline map.

Designed to be used without a persistent internet connection, the app caches maps on the Android device, and it can store as much map data as your device has storage available. 

The hardware is designed for field use and is ready for deployment on a chest rig, plate carrier, backpack, or any other means of carrying the device. Removable antennae allow the user to mount them remotely for better reception when necessary.
